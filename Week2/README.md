# User Analytics in the Telecomunication Industry
## Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
User Analytics can be divided into four major categories, namely:
* User Overview Analysis
* User Engagement Analysis
* User Experience Analysis
* User Satisfaction Analysis

### User Overview Analysis
This category involves understanding our users and their data. For the Telecommunication industry this step would involve understanding the handsets used by customers, the manufacturers of these handsets, the number of sessions held by the customers, the duration per session or as an aggregate, and the total data (upload and download) used by the users during these sessions.
Using EDA we can understand how the above metrics relate to each other and to themselves, how they are distributed across the dataset. The different type of analysis techniques we can use are:
* Non-Graphical Univariate Analysis
* Graphical Unvariate Analysis
* Bivariate Analyis
* Variable Transformation
* Correlation Analysis
* Dimensionality Reduction

### User Engagement Analysis
This category involves understanding how the Telcomunication company interacts with its users, and the ways they use for user engagement to ensure Quality of Service (QoS). The engagement metrics here are the session frequencies, the duration of sessions, and the total traffic (download and upload) in regards to the sessions.
Data analysis in this category is performed mainly through;
* Computation of Aggregations and
* Using K-Means Clustering technique

### User Experience Analysis
These analysis helps the telecommunication company/industry understand the needs and requirements of their users as well as track the perception of the users about their products. The experience metrics considered in this case are; the handset type, average TCP retransmission, Average RTT, and Average throughput
Data analysis involved in this section includes;
* Computation of aggregations
* Distribution plotting
* K-Means Clustering

### User Satisfaction Analysis
Satisfaction of a user is dependent on both their experience and engagement, and, therefore, this category relies on Engagement and Experience Analysis

## Conclusion
The above mentioned analysis are conducted systematically in the code file with the base reason of understanding the users. User Analytics help in decision making processes. For instance, the above analysis can be used to recommend on whether to invest in the telecommunication industry or not.

# A/B Hypothesis Testing
This project contains A/B hypothesis testing which attempts to compare between two variation (A and B) to test their performance.
This specific hypothesis tests whether there is a significant lift in brand awareness for SmartAd advertising campaign.
The two variations for this testing is a control group - who were showed a dummy ad - and an exposed group - who were shown an online, interactive ad with the SmartAd brand.
The level of brand awareness is then tested among the users by administering a questionnaire ```Do you know the brand SmartAd``` with Yes or No as response.

## Data Exploration
Just as any analysis, this project explores different data exploration techniques including:
* Unique Value Counts
* Frequence Counts
* Histograms
* Relational Plots


## Classical and Sequential A/B Testing
The Classical A/B testing using p-values is conducted in this project along with Sequential A/B Testing.
The two approaches are used to test the difference significance of the change in the SmartAd advertising campaign.
In this two approaches, you'll better understand statistical terms such as statistical power, significance level, mean difference error (mde), and basic conversion rate.

## A/B Testing with Machine Learning
The project further explores different Machine Learning Algorithms to test the hypothesis. Machine Learning Algorithms are used as alternative to A/B testing because they are faster, more complex, and best applicable in the real world.
The different Machine Learning Algorithms explored are:
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Trees
* XGBoost
Other additional concepts in the Machine Learning approach are:
* K-Fold Cross-Validation
* Loss Functions (Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error and R2 Score)
* Label Encoding
